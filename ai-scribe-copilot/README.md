# AI Scribe Copilot

A Flutter app that doctors can trust with their patient consultations. The app records audio during medical visits and streams it to a backend for AI transcription, with bulletproof interruption handling.

## 🎯 Core Features

### Real-Time Audio Streaming
- Stream audio chunks to backend during recording (not after)
- Continue recording with phone locked or app minimized
- Handle chunk ordering, retries, and network failures
- Native microphone access with proper gain control

### Bulletproof Interruption Handling
- **Phone calls**: Auto pause/resume
- **App switching**: Continue recording in background
- **Network outages**: Queue locally, retry when back
- **Phone restarts**: Recover unsent chunks
- **Memory pressure**: Graceful handling when system kills other apps

### Native Platform Features
- **Microphone**: Audio level visualization, gain control, Bluetooth/wired headset switching
- **System Integration**: Native share sheet, system notifications, haptic feedback
- **Background Services**: Android foreground service + iOS background audio

## 📱 Platform Support

- **Android**: APK available for download
- **iOS**: Demo video showing all features
- **Cross-Platform**: Flutter with native performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Android Studio / Xcode
- Docker (for backend)
- Node.js 18+ (for backend development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-scribe-copilot.git
   cd ai-scribe-copilot
   ```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # Android (emulator connects to 10.0.2.2 by default)
   flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000/api

   # iOS / macOS simulators default to localhost so the define is optional
   flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   ```

   If you deploy the backend elsewhere, update the `API_BASE_URL` define to
   match the HTTPS endpoint, e.g. `https://api.example.com`.

## 📦 Build Instructions

### Android APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://your.api.example
```
The APK will be available at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### iOS
```bash
flutter build ios --release --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://your.api.example
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Android Gradle "Cannot lock file hash cache" error

If Android Studio or `flutter run` fails with a message similar to:

```
Cannot lock file hash cache (.../android/.gradle/<version>/fileHashes) as it has already been locked by this process
```

We now pin the Android build to Gradle **8.10.2**, which avoids a locking bug
present in Gradle 8.12 on macOS. If you ran the project before this change, the
old cache may still be present locally. In that case, or if you continue to see
the error, it usually means a previous Gradle process crashed and left a stale
lock file.

1. Stop any running Gradle daemons:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew --stop
   ```
2. Delete the stale cache (safe to remove, Gradle will recreate it):
   ```bash
   rm -rf android/.gradle
   ```
3. Re-run your build command:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

If the problem persists, make sure there are no other Android Studio or Gradle
processes running, then repeat the steps above.

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Pass/Fail Tests
1. **Test 1**: Start 5-minute recording → Lock phone → Leave locked
   - ✅ **Pass**: Audio streams to backend, no data loss

2. **Test 2**: Recording → Phone call → End call
   - ✅ **Pass**: Auto-pause, auto-resume, no audio lost

3. **Test 3**: Recording → Airplane mode → Network returns
   - ✅ **Pass**: Chunks queue locally, upload when connected

4. **Test 4**: Recording → Open camera → Take photo → Return
   - ✅ **Pass**: Recording continues, proper native integration

5. **Test 5**: Recording → Kill app → Reopen
   - ✅ **Pass**: Graceful recovery, clear session state

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Services
- **AudioRecordingService**: Real-time audio recording and chunking
- **BackgroundService**: Handles interruptions and background processing

- `POST /v1/get-presigned-url` - Get chunk upload URL
- `PUT {presignedUrl}` - Upload audio chunk
- `POST /v1/notify-chunk-uploaded` - Confirm chunk received

### Patient Management
- `GET /v1/patients?userId={userId}` - Get patients
- `POST /v1/add-patient-ext` - Add patient
- `GET /v1/fetch-session-by-patient/{patientId}` - Get sessions
